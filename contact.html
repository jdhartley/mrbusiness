    <h3>Contact Mr Business</h3>
    <p>Working with Mr Business really comes down to proper communication and synergy. Many man-hours are lost a minute if you are not in constant sync. Therefore, staying in contact with Mr Business could not be easier: simply send me an E-mail</p>

    <p><em style="font-size:.85em">*Note: though any real businessman is already familiar with this situation, be reminded that LinkedIn, Skype, SMS, and BBM account information must be shared inside a vCard immediately upon sending any E-mail, or you will be ignored.</em></p>

    <form onsubmit="alert('Inbox full. Please contact your Business Email provider to upgrade to an enterprise business level.'); this.reset(); return false;">
        <p><label>Your Name: <input type="text" name="name" required /></label></p>
        <p><label>Your E-mail: <input type="email" name="email" required /></label></p>
        <p><label>Your Message<br /><textarea cols="60" rows="5" name="message" required></textarea></label></p>
        <p><button type="submit">Send Mr Business an E-mail</button></p>
    </form>

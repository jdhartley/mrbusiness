# Mr Business
Hello. This is Mr Business speaking. I have some important Business to get to, so I'll make this quick.

This is the repo for my Internet Web site, [mrbusiness.rocks](http://mrbusiness.rocks/)â€”but you already knew that, because it's your Home Page.

Anyway, listen. I don't exactly have a lot of time to work on this Web site, so if you can spare some of your time, I would appreciate it more than you do a Christmas bonus.

## Building and compiling
I outsource the static site generation to this [open-source Business called Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ (free software is amazing)). You can read up on how to install it on their site (or just hire someone to read it to you). `jekyll build` will do all of the magic for you once it is installed.

## Contributing
I don't have all day to look at your code, and I definitely can't afford to let a programmer mess it up, so this is one job I will not outsource to Cambodia.

Keep your pull requests short and sweet and they'll get merged. Business as usual.

## 401k
If you want to contribute to my "401k" and help pay for my "retirement" (Internet Web site super computer servers), hit me up on LinkedIn. I am always up for investment.
